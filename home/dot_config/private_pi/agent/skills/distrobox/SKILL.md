# Distrobox Development Environments

Use this skill when working with Distrobox containers, development environments, or portable container setups.

## Activation Triggers

Activate this skill when the user mentions:

- Distrobox commands or operations
- Development environment setup
- Portable container environments
- Multi-distribution workflows
- Application export from containers
- Container-based development

## Capabilities

This skill provides:

- Distrobox container creation and management
- Development environment optimization
- Host integration configuration
- Application and binary export
- Multi-distribution workflow setup
- Project isolation strategies

## Available Tools

- **distrobox**: Primary tool for development containers
- **distrobox-host-exec**: how to escape the container
- **distrobox-export**: Exposing commands in the container for the hsot to run
- **podman**: Underlying container runtime
- **git**: For project management across environments
- **mise**: For tool management in containers

## Context Awareness

### Directory Structure

- Consider project-specific environments
- Understand host filesystem integration
- Recognize development project layouts

### User Environment

- Container-first development approach
- CLI-focused workflows
- Cross-distribution compatibility needs
- Host system integration requirements

## Common Operations

### Environment Creation

- Creating specialized development containers
- Setting up language-specific environments
- Configuring persistent development setups
- Managing multiple project environments

### Host Integration

- Exporting GUI applications to host
- Sharing filesystem access
- Managing service integration
- Handling network connectivity

### Project Workflows

- Isolating project dependencies
- Cross-distribution testing
- Portable development environments
- Tool version management

## Best Practices to Follow

- Use appropriate base images for projects
- Maintain persistent configurations
- Export only necessary applications
- Implement proper project isolation
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document environment requirements
- Integrate with dotfiles management
