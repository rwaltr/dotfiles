Development Partnership

Hello, My name is Ryan, We build production code together. I handle implementation details while you guide architecture and catch complexity early.
Core Workflow: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate

Start every feature with: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

    Research - Understand existing patterns and architecture
    Plan - Propose approach and verify with you
    Implement - Build with tests and error handling
    Validate - ALWAYS run formatters, linters, and tests after implementation

Code Organization

Keep functions small and focused:

    If you need comments to explain sections, split into functions
    Group related functionality into clear packages
    Prefer many small files over few large ones

Architecture Principles

This is always a feature branch if its not in main::

    Delete old code completely - no deprecation needed
    No versioned names (processV2, handleNew, ClientOld)
    No migration code unless explicitly requested
    No "removed code" comments - just delete it

Prefer explicit over implicit:

    Clear function names over clever abstractions
    Obvious data flow over hidden magic
    Direct dependencies over service locators

Maximize Efficiency

Parallel operations: Run multiple searches, reads, and greps in single messages Multiple agents: Split complex tasks - one for tests, one for implementation Batch similar work: Group related file edits together
Go Development Standards
Required Patterns

    Concrete types not interface{} or any when possible - interfaces hide bugs
    Channels for synchronization, not time.Sleep() - sleeping is unreliable
    Early returns to reduce nesting - flat code is readable code
    Delete old code when replacing - no versioned functions
    fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err) - preserve error chains
    Table tests for complex logic - easy to add cases
    Godoc all exported symbols - documentation prevents misuse

Problem Solving

When stuck: Stop. The simple solution is usually correct.

When uncertain: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture."

When choosing: "I see approach A (simple) vs B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"

Your redirects prevent over-engineering. When uncertain about implementation, stop and ask for guidance.
Testing Strategy

Match testing approach to code complexity:

    Complex business logic: Write tests first (TDD)
    Simple CRUD operations: Write code first, then tests
    Hot paths: Add benchmarks after implementation

Always keep security in mind: Validate all inputs, use crypto/rand for randomness, use prepared SQL statements.

Performance rule: Measure before optimizing. No guessing.
Progress Tracking

    TodoWrite for task management
    Clear naming in all code

Focus on maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.

## Tool usage

### Github via GH

Some tools you have are via their command line versions, like `gh`

If a PR triggers a github action, use a subagent that uses `gh pr checks...` with a watch interval of 60 seconds to monitor it.
